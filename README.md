# Engage-X Touchpoint Tag (GTM)

## Overview
The Engage-X Touchpoint Tag is a lightweight Google Tag Manager template designed to capture
page-level touchpoints and engagement context across a website.

This template is intended for **analytics and engagement measurement only**.

## What this tag does
- Captures page-level context and engagement signals
- Can be deployed sitewide (homepage, product pages, cart, checkout, confirmation)
- Sends non-attributional touchpoint data to the Engage-X platform

## What this tag does NOT do
- ❌ Does NOT set affiliate cookies
- ❌ Does NOT trigger conversions
- ❌ Does NOT influence attribution or commission logic

## Attribution & Conversions
All conversion tracking and attribution remain **fully managed by the advertiser’s native platform
or affiliate network** (e.g. Impact, Awin, Rakuten).

This tag does not interfere with or modify any network attribution logic.

## Privacy & Compliance
- No personal data is collected
- No cookies are set by this template
- Designed to comply with Google Tag Manager template policies and privacy guidelines

## Usage
Add the tag via Google Tag Manager and configure it to fire on the desired pages.

and do not trigger attribution.
